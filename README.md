# A real-time audio spectral analysis toolbox for Unity3D

The project consists of a script implementing some audio descriptors
- Spectral Centroid
- Spectral Spread
- Spectral Tilt
- Spectral Entropy
- Spectral Flux
- RMS Energy
- Zero Crossing Rate

The real-time Fourier Transform is handled by MathNet.Numerics library.
